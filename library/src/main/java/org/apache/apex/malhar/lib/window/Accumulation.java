 * This interface is for the processing part of the WindowedOperator.

 * In most cases, AccumT is the same as OutputT. But in some cases, the accumulated type and the output type may be
 * different. For example, if we are doing the AVERAGE of doubles, InputT will be double, and we need the SUM and the
 * COUNT stored as type AccumT, and AccumT will be a pair of double and long, in which double is the sum of the inputs,
 * and long is the number of inputs. OutputT will be double, because it represents the average of the inputs.
