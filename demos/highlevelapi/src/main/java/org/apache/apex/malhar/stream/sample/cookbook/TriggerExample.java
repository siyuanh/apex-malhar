/**
 * This example illustrates the basic concepts behind triggering. It shows how to use different
 * trigger definitions to produce partial (speculative) results before all the data is processed and
 * to control when updated results are produced for late data. The example performs a streaming
 * analysis of the data coming in from PubSub and writes the results to BigQuery. It divides the
 * data into {@link Window windows} to be processed, and demonstrates using various kinds of
 * {@link org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.windowing.Trigger triggers} to control when the results for
 * each window are emitted.
 *
 * <p> This example uses a portion of real traffic data from San Diego freeways. It contains
 * readings from sensor stations set up along each freeway. Each sensor reading includes a
 * calculation of the 'total flow' across all lanes in that freeway direction.
 *
 * <p> Concepts:
 * <pre>
 *   1. The default triggering behavior
 *   2. Late data with the default trigger
 *   3. How to get speculative estimates
 *   4. Combining late data and speculative estimates
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p> Before running this example, it will be useful to familiarize yourself with Dataflow triggers
 * and understand the concept of 'late data',
 * See:  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/model/triggers">
 * https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/model/triggers </a> and
 * <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/model/windowing#Advanced">
 * https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/model/windowing#Advanced </a>
 *
 * <p> The example pipeline reads data from a Pub/Sub topic. By default, running the example will
 * also run an auxiliary pipeline to inject data from the default {@code --input} file to the
 * {@code --pubsubTopic}. The auxiliary pipeline puts a timestamp on the injected data so that the
 * example pipeline can operate on <i>event time</i> (rather than arrival time). The auxiliary
 * pipeline also randomly simulates late data, by setting the timestamps of some of the data
 * elements to be in the past. You may override the default {@code --input} with the file of your
 * choosing or set {@code --input=""} which will disable the automatic Pub/Sub injection, and allow
 * you to use a separate tool to publish to the given topic.
 *
 * <p> The example is configured to use the default Pub/Sub topic and the default BigQuery table
 * from the example common package (there are no defaults for a general Dataflow pipeline).
 * You can override them by using the {@code --pubsubTopic}, {@code --bigQueryDataset}, and
 * {@code --bigQueryTable} options. If the Pub/Sub topic or the BigQuery table do not exist,
 * the example will try to create them.
 *
 * <p> The pipeline outputs its results to a BigQuery table.
 * Here are some queries you can use to see interesting results:
 * Replace {@code <enter_table_name>} in the query below with the name of the BigQuery table.
 * Replace {@code <enter_window_interval>} in the query below with the window interval.
 *
 * <p> To see the results of the default trigger,
 * Note: When you start up your pipeline, you'll initially see results from 'late' data. Wait after
 * the window duration, until the first pane of non-late data has been emitted, to see more
 * interesting results.
 * {@code SELECT * FROM enter_table_name WHERE trigger_type = "default" ORDER BY window DESC}
 *
 * <p> To see the late data i.e. dropped by the default trigger,
 * {@code SELECT * FROM <enter_table_name> WHERE trigger_type = "withAllowedLateness" and
 * (timing = "LATE" or timing = "ON_TIME") and freeway = "5" ORDER BY window DESC, processing_time}
 *
 * <p>To see the the difference between accumulation mode and discarding mode,
 * {@code SELECT * FROM <enter_table_name> WHERE (timing = "LATE" or timing = "ON_TIME") AND
 * (trigger_type = "withAllowedLateness" or trigger_type = "sequential") and freeway = "5" ORDER BY
 * window DESC, processing_time}
 *
 * <p> To see speculative results every minute,
 * {@code SELECT * FROM <enter_table_name> WHERE trigger_type = "speculative" and freeway = "5"
 * ORDER BY window DESC, processing_time}
 *
 * <p> To see speculative results every five minutes after the end of the window
 * {@code SELECT * FROM <enter_table_name> WHERE trigger_type = "sequential" and timing != "EARLY"
 * and freeway = "5" ORDER BY window DESC, processing_time}
 *
 * <p> To see the first and the last pane for a freeway in a window for all the trigger types,
 * {@code SELECT * FROM <enter_table_name> WHERE (isFirst = true or isLast = true) ORDER BY window}
 *
 * <p> To reduce the number of results for each query we can add additional where clauses.
 * For examples, To see the results of the default trigger,
 * {@code SELECT * FROM <enter_table_name> WHERE trigger_type = "default" AND freeway = "5" AND
 * window = "<enter_window_interval>"}
 *
 * <p> The example will try to cancel the pipelines on the signal to terminate the process (CTRL-C)
 * and then exits.
